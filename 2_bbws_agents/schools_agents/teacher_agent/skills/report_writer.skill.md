## Sample Reports

### Example 1: Quarterly Progress Report (Elementary)
```markdown
**Progress Report - Quarter 2**
**Student**: Emma Johnson
**Grade**: 3rd Grade
**Teacher**: Ms. Rodriguez

**Reading (B+)**
Emma is making excellent progress in reading! She reads fluently and with good
expression. She especially enjoys chapter books and has been reading above grade
level. To continue growing, Emma should work on summarizing what she reads and
making deeper inferences about characters' motivations.

**Math (B)**
Emma shows a solid understanding of multiplication facts and can solve multi-step
word problems. She sometimes rushes through her work, which leads to careless
errors. Encouraging her to double-check her work will help improve accuracy.

**Writing (A-)**
Emma's writing has improved significantly this quarter! Her stories are creative
and well-organized. She is learning to use more descriptive language and varied
sentence structures. Continue to encourage daily writing at home.

**Attendance**: 42 days present, 2 absences (excused)

**Overall**: Emma is a motivated student who takes pride in her work. She
participates enthusiastically and is a positive role model for her classmates.
Keep up the great work!
```

### Example 2: Parent Communication (Concern)
```markdown
Subject: Quick Check-In About Math Homework

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Chen,

I wanted to reach out regarding Kevin's math homework completion. I've noticed
that Kevin has not turned in homework for the past three assignments (10/15,
10/17, 10/20).

In class, Kevin demonstrates understanding of the concepts when we work together,
so I'm confident he has the skills to complete the work. I'm wondering if there
might be something at home preventing him from finishing his assignments, or if
he might benefit from additional support.

Could we schedule a brief call this week to discuss how we can work together to
help Kevin stay on track? I'm available Tuesday or Thursday after school.

Thank you for your partnership!

Best regards,
Ms. Thompson
```

### Example 3: IEP Progress Report
```markdown
**IEP Progress Report**
**Student**: Marcus Williams
**Quarter**: Q2
**Case Manager**: Mrs. Anderson

**IEP Goal 1**: Marcus will read grade-level text with 90% accuracy.
**Progress**: Marcus is currently reading at 85% accuracy. He has improved
significantly in decoding multi-syllabic words. Continue small group intervention
3x weekly.
**Status**: Progressing toward goal

**IEP Goal 2**: Marcus will write a 5-sentence paragraph with topic sentence and
supporting details.
**Progress**: Marcus can now write 4-sentence paragraphs independently. He is
working on adding concluding sentences. Graphic organizers have been very helpful.
**Status**: Progressing toward goal

**Accommodations**: Marcus is receiving all accommodations as outlined in his IEP
(extended time, preferential seating, breaks as needed). These continue to support
his success.

**Recommendations**: Continue current interventions and accommodations. Consider
adding peer buddy for writing workshop.
