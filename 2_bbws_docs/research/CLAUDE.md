## TBT Workflow for Research

When conducting research:
1. **Log** - Record research task in history.log
2. **Plan** - Create research plan with questions and approach
3. **Snapshot** - Not typically needed for research
4. **Implement** - Conduct research and document findings
5. **Verify** - Review findings for completeness and accuracy

## Parent Workflow Inheritance

This folder inherits all TBT workflow and standards from the parent documentation project:
