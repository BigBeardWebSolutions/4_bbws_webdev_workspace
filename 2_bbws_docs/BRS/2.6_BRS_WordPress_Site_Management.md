## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the **business requirements** for WordPress Site Management - the self-service capability that enables BBWS customers to create, configure, and manage their WordPress websites without requiring BBWS staff intervention.

### 1.2 Business Context

BBWS provides managed WordPress hosting to businesses. Customers need the ability to:
- Create new websites quickly for campaigns, products, or divisions
- Apply professional templates without design expertise
- Install plugins to add functionality (forms, SEO, e-commerce)
- Manage site lifecycle (suspend, clone, promote to production)

Currently, these operations require support tickets and manual intervention, creating delays and increasing operational costs.

### 1.3 Solution Overview

WordPress Site Management provides a self-service portal where customers can:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Site Creation** | Launch new WordPress sites in minutes, not days |
| **Template Marketplace** | Browse and apply pre-built professional templates |
| **Plugin Management** | Install, configure, and update plugins safely |
| **Environment Promotion** | Move sites from development to testing to production |

### 1.4 Key Benefits

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Faster Time-to-Market** | New sites ready in minutes instead of days |
| **Reduced Support Costs** | Self-service eliminates 80% of site management tickets |
| **Consistent Quality** | Templates ensure professional, standardized sites |
| **Enhanced Security** | Plugin vetting prevents security vulnerabilities |
| **Customer Satisfaction** | Immediate control increases NPS scores |

---

## 2. Business Problem

### 2.1 Current State

| Challenge | Business Impact |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Manual site creation | 2-3 days to launch a new site |
| No template library | Customers hire designers or use inconsistent themes |
| Unvetted plugins | Security vulnerabilities from untested plugins |
| No staging environments | Changes go directly to production, risking downtime |
| Support dependency | Every site change requires a support ticket |

### 2.2 Desired State

| Capability | Business Outcome |
|------------|------------------|
| Self-service site creation | New site ready in under 15 minutes |
| Template marketplace | Professional site launched same day |
| Curated plugin library | Zero security incidents from plugins |
| Development/staging environments | Test changes before production |
| Customer autonomy | 80% reduction in support tickets |

### 2.3 Why Now?

- **Customer demand**: Top requested feature in customer surveys
- **Competitive pressure**: Competitors offer self-service portals
- **Operational cost**: Support tickets for site management are unsustainable at scale
- **Growth enablement**: Manual processes cannot scale with customer growth
