## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

The **WordPress Instance Management** capability enables the BBWS platform to automatically create, manage, and retire dedicated WordPress environments for each customer organisation. This automation transforms a labour-intensive manual process into a streamlined, reliable, and scalable operation.

### 1.2 Business Context

When a new customer signs up for the BBWS WordPress hosting service, they require a fully operational WordPress environment. Historically, creating this environment required manual intervention by technical staff, taking several hours and introducing opportunities for error. This requirement creates a critical bottleneck that limits growth and increases operational costs.

WordPress Instance Management solves this by automating the entire process from customer onboarding to offboarding, allowing the business to scale without proportionally increasing operational headcount.

### 1.3 Key Benefits

| Benefit | Business Impact |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Rapid Customer Activation** | Customers are operational in minutes rather than hours, improving first impressions |
| **Reduced Operational Costs** | Automation eliminates manual provisioning labour costs |
| **Consistent Quality** | Standardised setup process eliminates configuration errors |
| **Scalable Growth** | Platform can grow without operations bottleneck |
| **Reliable Offboarding** | Clean customer exit protects data and reduces orphaned resources |

### 1.4 Document Relationship

| Document | Focus Area |
|----------|------------|
| **BRS 2.5: Tenant Management** | Customer organisation setup, user assignments, hierarchy |
| **BRS 2.6: WordPress Site Management** | Site content, templates, plugins within a customer environment |
| **BRS 2.7: WordPress Instance Management (This)** | Creating and managing the customer's dedicated WordPress environment |
